An abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword.
An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
We can not create object of abstract class.
By default abstact class has parametrised method
No, you cannot create abstract variables in an abstract class in Java.
 Abstract is a concept that applies to methods and classes, not to variables.


 🔹 Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding implementation details and only showing relevant
  functionalities to the user.

 🔹 Key Idea:

 Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
 Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features
 of the object. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
Important point-1.Abstraction - Only shows 'start' behavior, hides how it works
                    abstract class Vehicle {
                        abstract void start();
                    }

               2. abstraction hides logic and complexity.
               3.Using interfaces or abstract classes to hide implementation.

 example - // Abstraction: Interface exposes only essential operations
           interface RemoteControl {
               void turnOn();
               void turnOff();
           }
           // Implementation details are hidden from the user
           class Television implements RemoteControl {
               @Override
               public void turnOn() {
                   System.out.println("Television is ON");
                   // Internally: connect power, enable display, etc.
               }

               @Override
               public void turnOff() {
                   System.out.println("Television is OFF");
                   // Internally: shut down circuits, stop signal, etc.
               }
           }
      // Main class - using abstraction
      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              RemoteControl remote = new Television();
              remote.turnOn();   // User only knows what to call, not how it's done
              remote.turnOff();
          }
      }
RemoteControl is the abstraction — it exposes what can be done: turnOn() and turnOff().

Television provides the hidden implementation — how these actions work internally is not shown to the user.

In Main, the user just interacts with the interface, not the detailed logic.
