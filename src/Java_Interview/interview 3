Q->consider a class person , has data field string name and list<String> degress ..
how make  class as immutable.and advantage and disadvantage of immutable
anser->
To make the Person class immutable in Java, follow these principles:

Declare the class as final: This prevents subclassing, ensuring no overriding of behavior that could compromise immutability.
Declare fields as private and final: This ensures they are not modified after initialization.
Initialize all fields via the constructor: Avoid setters or any other methods that allow modifying the fields.
Ensure defensive copying: When working with mutable fields like List<String>, provide a copy of the collection
during assignment and when returning it.
Avoid this leakage: Do not expose the this reference during object construction.

Example: Immutable Person Class
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public final class Person {
    private final String name;
    private final List<String> degrees;

    public Person(String name, List<String> degrees) {
        if (name == null || degrees == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Fields cannot be null");
        }
        this.name = name;
        // Create a defensive copy of the list
        this.degrees = new ArrayList<>(degrees);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public List<String> getDegrees() {
        // Return an unmodifiable view of the list
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(degrees);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', degrees=" + degrees + "}";
    }
}



Advantages of Immutable Classes
Thread-Safe: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe as their state cannot be changed after creation, avoiding
             synchronization issues.
Predictable Behavior: They are easier to reason about, as their state remains constant.
HashMap/HashSet Friendly: Can safely be used as keys in collections like HashMap or HashSet without worrying about state
                          changes affecting their hash code.
Caching: Immutable objects can be cached or reused, reducing object creation overhead.
Disadvantages of Immutable Classes
Memory Overhead: Creating new objects for every change (e.g., adding to the degrees list) can lead to higher memory
                 usage compared to mutable objects.
Inflexibility: Requires creating new objects to reflect state changes, which might be cumbersome in some use cases.
Performance: Defensive copying for collections can introduce performance overhead, especially for large collections.
