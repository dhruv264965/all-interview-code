🔹 Joins (Basics)


1. Get employee names with their department names.

SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;


2. List all employees even if they don’t belong to a department.

SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;


3. Find employees who don’t belong to any department.

SELECT e.emp_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.dept_id IS NULL;

🔹 Aggregation & GROUP BY

4. Count employees in each department based in id .

SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;

4.1  Count employees in each department based in name means Dept_name and no. of employee each deaprtment

     select  d.dept_name , count(*) as emp_count
     from employees e
     join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
     group by d.dept_name;

     But note: with the inner join, if a department has 0 employees, it won’t appear in the result.
     If you want to show departments even with 0 employees, use LEFT JOIN:

     select  d.dept_name  , count(*) as emp_count
          from employees e
          left join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
          group by d.dept_name;

4.2  Depart name and avg salary of each department

    select d.dept_name , avg(e.salary) as avg_salary
    from employees e
    join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
    group by d.dept_name;

     Find the department name with the highest average salary.
    SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees e
    join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
    GROUP BY dept_name
    ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
    LIMIT 1;

4.3  Depart name and sum salary of each department

        select d.dept_name , sum(e.salary) as sum_salary
        from employees e
        join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
        group by d.dept_name;


5. Find average salary per department.

SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;


6. Find departments with more than 5 employees.

SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

6.1 find department name having more than 3 employee

SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees e
join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;


7. Find max salary per department.

SELECT dept_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;

🔹 ORDER BY & Top-N

8. Get top 3 highest paid employees.

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;


9. Find second highest salary.

SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
limit 1 offset 2;


10. Find Nth highest salary (example: 3rd).

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE 3 = (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary)
  FROM employees e2
  WHERE e2.salary >= e1.salary
);

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
limit n-1, 1;    limit(m,n)-> m-> number of rows to skip and n-> number of rows to fetch

🔹 Subqueries

11. Find employees earning more than the average salary.

SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);


12. Find employee(s) with highest salary in each department.

SELECT emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM employees e
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id);

12.1 Find employee(s) with highest salary in each department.

SELECT d.dept_name, e.emp_name, e.salary AS max_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id
);


13. Find employees earning more than their department’s average.

SELECT emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id
);

🔹 Practical Joins

14. Find employees earning more than their manager.

SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary, m.emp_name AS manager, m.salary AS mgr_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;


15. Find employees hired before their manager.

SELECT e.emp_name, m.emp_name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id
WHERE e.hire_date < m.hire_date;

FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;

5. Find employees earning more than their manager

HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

4. Get the second highest salary from the Employee table

Method 1: Using LIMIT (MySQL/Postgres)

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;


Method 2: Using MAX + Subquery (works in most SQL databases)

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM Employee

5. Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively

(Assume table is Logs(id INT, num INT))

WHERE l1.num = l2.num
  AND l2.num = l3.num;

6. Find employees who earn more than their managers

9. Find the highest-paid employee in each department

Question:
"Get the employee(s) with the maximum salary per department."

Answer:

SELECT e.*
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
) t
ON e.department = t.department AND e.salary = t.max_salary;


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Find the maximum salary in each department(average, total salary , Count employees)

      SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
      FROM employees
      GROUP BY department;

      if two table is there then same code we can write


      select e.dept_id , max (salary) as max_salary
      from employee e
      JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
      group by e.dept_id

2.   Order departments by average salary (descending)

   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department
   ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

3 .   Get the department with the most employees

     SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department
     ORDER BY emp_count DESC
     LIMIT 1;

4.    Find employees earning more than their department’s average salary

      SELECT e.name, e.department, e.salary
      FROM employees e
      JOIN (
          SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
          FROM employees
          GROUP BY department
      ) t
      ON e.department = t.department
      WHERE e.salary > t.avg_salary;


     if two table is there

      SELECT e.name, d.dept_name, e.salary
      FROM employees e
      JOIN (
          SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
          FROM employees
          GROUP BY dept_id
      ) t
      ON e.dept_id = t.dept_id
      JOIN departments d
      ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
      WHERE e.salary > t.avg_salary;


5.    2. Find employees who don’t belong to any department

      SELECT e.name
      FROM employees e
      LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
      WHERE d.dept_id IS NULL;


6.  Find the department name with the highest average salary.
        SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
        FROM employees e
        join departments d on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
        GROUP BY dept_name
        ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
        LIMIT 1;
