| **What it does**      | Actually **throws** an exception                  | Declares that a method **may throw** an exception                |
| **Used inside**       | A method or block                                 | Method signature                                                 |
| **When used**         | During *runtime* to trigger an exception manually | During *compile time* to tell the caller to handle the exception |
| **Can throw**         | Only **one** exception at a time                  | Can declare **multiple** exceptions                              |
| **Type of exception** | Usually customized, runtime, or checked           | Only checked exceptions (mostly)                                 |
| **Keyword position**  | After `throw new Exception()`                     | After method name                                                |


📌 1. throw keyword (Used to throw an exception manually)

You use throw when you want to create and throw your own exception.

Example
public void checkAge(int age) {
    if(age < 18) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("You are not eligible");
    }
    System.out.println("Eligible");
}
You are not eligible
👉 Here the exception is actually thrown inside the method.


📌 2. throws keyword (Used in method signature)

You use throws when the method may throw an exception, but you don't want to handle it inside the method.

Example
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("data.txt");
}


👉 This tells the caller:
“I may throw IOException, you handle it.”

Caller must handle it:


  3->if u want to handle the exception  at   compile  time then we use throws
// 3-> if u want to trigger the exception  manually   at   Run   time then we use throw
