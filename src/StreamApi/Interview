Q->What is stream and parallel Stream in java 8
ans->1. stream()
     Definition: A sequential stream that processes elements one at a time in a single thread.
     Execution: Processes data in the order it appears (maintains encounter order for ordered collections like lists).
     Threading: Operates in a single thread (the main thread by default).
     Use Case: Best suited for small or simple data processing tasks where parallelism is unnecessary.
     Performance: Lower overhead than parallelStream for smaller datasets since no additional threads are created.
     List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
     names.stream()
          .forEach(name -> System.out.println(name + " processed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
     output-Alice processed by main
           Bob processed by main
           Charlie processed by main
2. parallelStream()
Definition: A parallel stream that divides the data into multiple chunks and processes them in parallel using
            the Fork/Join framework.
Execution: Tasks are distributed across multiple threads (from the common ForkJoinPool).
Threading: Utilizes multiple threads to process elements concurrently.
Use Case: Best suited for large datasets or computationally intensive tasks where parallelism can improve performance.
Performance: Can be faster than stream() for large datasets but involves overhead for thread management.
              Performance may degrade for small datasets due to parallelization overhead.
Order: May not maintain encounter order unless explicitly specified.
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.parallelStream()
     .forEach(name -> System.out.println(name + " processed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
output-Charlie processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
       Bob processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
       Alice processed by main

Key Differences
Aspect	                     Sequential	                                      Parallel
Threading	                  Single thread (main thread)	                  Multiple threads (ForkJoinPool)
Order Preservation	           Maintains encounter order	                   May not maintain order
Performance	                      Faster for small datasets	                  Faster for large datasets
Overhead	                       Low	                                             High (thread management)

When to Use Which?
Use stream():

For small datasets.
When processing order matters.
For tasks with low computational complexity.
Use parallelStream():

For large datasets.
When order doesn't matter (or when explicitly controlled).
For computationally intensive tasks that benefit from parallelism.
