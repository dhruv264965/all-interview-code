*One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value). If you try to insert the duplicate key in HashMap,
 it will
replace the element of the corresponding key.
*Java HashMap is similar to HashTable, but it is unsynchronized. It allows to store the null keys as well, but
 there should be only one
 null key object and there can be any number of null values. This class makes no guarantees as to the order of
 the map. To use this
 class and its methods, you need to import java.util.HashMap package or its superclass.
* Allows duplicates: HashMaps allow for duplicate values, but not duplicate keys. If a duplicate key is added, the previous value
 associated with the key is overwritten.
*Not ordered: HashMaps are not ordered, which means that the order in which elements are added to the map is not preserved.
 However, "LinkedHashMap" is a variation of HashMap that preserves the insertion order.
*Thread-unsafe: HashMaps are not thread-safe, which means that if multiple threads access the same hashmap simultaneously, it can lead
to data inconsistencies. If thread safety is required, "ConcurrentHashMap" can be used.

Advantages of Java HashMap
Fast retrieval: HashMaps provide constant time access to elements, which means that retrieval and insertion of elements is very fast.
Efficient storage: HashMaps use a hashing function to map keys to indices in an array. This allows for quick lookup of values based on keys, and efficient storage of data.
Flexibility: HashMaps allow for null keys and values, and can store key-value pairs of any data type.
Easy to use: HashMaps have a simple interface and can be easily implemented in Java.
Suitable for large data sets: HashMaps can handle large data sets without slowing down.

Disadvantages of Java HashMap
Unordered: HashMaps are not ordered, which means that the order in which elements are added to the map is not preserved.
Not thread-safe: HashMaps are not thread-safe, which means that if multiple threads access the same hashmap simultaneously, it can lead to data inconsistencies.
Performance can degrade: In some cases, if the hashing function is not properly implemented or if the load factor is too high, the performance of a HashMap can degrade.
More complex than arrays or lists: HashMaps can be more complex to understand and use than simple arrays or lists, especially for beginners.
Higher memory usage: Since HashMaps use an underlying array, they can use more memory than other data structures like arrays or lists. This can be a disadvantage if memory usage is a concern.
