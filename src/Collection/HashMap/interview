Q->suppose we have employee class and we want to use that class as a key in hashmap so what chhanges is requried ?
answer->To use an Employee class as a key in a HashMap, you need to ensure that the Employee class provides proper
           implementations of the hashCode() and equals() methods. This is because HashMap uses these methods
           internally to manage and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.

           equals():

           Checks if the current object is the same as the passed object (this == obj).
           Ensures the passed object is not null and belongs to the Employee class.
           Compares meaningful fields (id and name) for equality.
           hashCode():

           Uses Objects.hash() to generate a consistent hash code based on the same fields used in equals().

           import java.util.Objects;

           public class Employee {
               private int id;
               private String name;

               // Constructor
               public Employee(int id, String name) {
                   this.id = id;
                   this.name = name;
               }

               // Getters and Setters
               public int getId() {
                   return id;
               }

               public void setId(int id) {
                   this.id = id;
               }

               public String getName() {
                   return name;
               }

               public void setName(String name) {
                   this.name = name;
               }

               // Override equals
               @Override
               public boolean equals(Object obj) {
                   if (this == obj) return true;
                   if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
                   Employee employee = (Employee) obj;
                   return id == employee.id && Objects.equals(name, employee.name);
               }

               // Override hashCode
               @Override
               public int hashCode() {
                   return Objects.hash(id, name);
               }

               @Override
               public String toString() {
                   return "Employee{id=" + id + ", name='" + name + "'}";
               }
           }


import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Employee, String> employeeMap = new HashMap<>();

        Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "Alice");
        Employee e2 = new Employee(2, "Bob");
        Employee e3 = new Employee(1, "Alice"); // Same as e1 based on id and name

        employeeMap.put(e1, "Manager");
        employeeMap.put(e2, "Developer");

        // Retrieve values
        System.out.println("e1 Role: " + employeeMap.get(e1)); // Manager
        System.out.println("e3 Role: " + employeeMap.get(e3)); // Manager
    }
}


problem- 2. Fields used in equals() and hashCode() are mutable
         If the fields that determine equality (e.g., id or name) are modified after the object is used as a key in the HashMap, it can break the contract of the HashMap. As a result, the key becomes inaccessible.
         Example Problem:
         Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "Alice");
         employeeMap.put(e1, "Manager");

         // Modify the key fields
         e1.setName("Alice Changed");

         // Now the key is "lost"
         System.out.println(employeeMap.get(e1)); // null
Solution:
Avoid modifying fields used in equals() and hashCode() after the object is added to the HashMap.
Alternatively, use immutable fields (e.g., mark them as final).


3. Different Employee instances with identical values
If two Employee objects have the same values but hashCode() and equals() are not overridden, they will be treated
as different keys because Object's default implementation uses memory addresses for equality and hash code.
Example Problem:
Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "Alice");
Employee e3 = new Employee(1, "Alice"); // Same content, different instances

employeeMap.put(e1, "Manager");
System.out.println(employeeMap.get(e3)); // null (if hashCode() and equals() are not overridden)
Solution:
Override hashCode() and equals() as shown earlier. When overridden, e1.equals(e3) will return true, and employeeMap.get(e3) will work as expected.


Interview Questions-
1. General HashMap Behavior
Q1: What happens if two keys in a HashMap have the same hashCode() but are not equal?

Answer: The HashMap will store both keys in the same bucket (collision handling), but they will be distinguishable
by their equals() method. Retrieval will still work correctly.
Q2: What happens if you override hashCode() but not equals()?

Answer: The HashMap might fail to retrieve an object, as the contract between hashCode() and equals() would be
violated. Two objects with the same hashCode() might not be considered equal.
Q3: What happens if the hashCode() of a key changes after it is inserted into the HashMap?

Answer: The HashMap will not be able to find the key, as it uses the original hashCode() to determine the bucket
where the key is stored.
2. Practical Scenarios
Q4: Write a custom Employee class where only the id field determines equality and hash code. How would this impact
the behavior of HashMap?

Follow-up: Add a name field and ask how it can impact the design.
Answer: Implementing equals() and hashCode() based on id ensures that two employees with the same id are treated
as equal, regardless of their name. However, if name changes dynamically and needs to be considered, the
implementation must account for mutability.
Q5: How would you prevent users from modifying fields used in equals() and hashCode() once an object is used as
a key in a HashMap?

Answer: Make those fields final or encapsulate them with immutable types.
3. Performance Considerations
Q6: What is the impact of poorly implemented hashCode() methods in a HashMap?

Answer: Poorly implemented hashCode() (e.g., always returning the same value) can lead to frequent collisions,
causing all entries to go into the same bucket. This degrades HashMap performance from O(1) to O(n) for lookups.
Q7: What are the advantages of using Objects.hash() for hashCode() implementation?

Answer: Objects.hash() provides a simple and efficient way to compute hash codes for multiple fields while
ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate code.
4. Conceptual Questions
Q8: Can an object be used as a key in a HashMap if hashCode() and equals() are not overridden?

Answer: Yes, but it will use the default implementations from Object, where hashCode() is based on memory
 address, and equals() compares references. This may lead to unintended behavior when comparing logically equal objects.
Q9: Why is it recommended to override both hashCode() and equals() when creating custom keys for HashMap?

Answer: To fulfill the contract that equal objects must have the same hash code, ensuring consistent
behavior for lookups and storage.
5. Comparison with Other Collections
Q10: What is the difference between using an Employee as a key in a HashMap versus in a TreeMap?

Answer:
HashMap relies on hashCode() and equals() for key comparison.
TreeMap relies on the natural ordering of keys (via Comparable) or a custom Comparator.
Q11: Can you use an Employee object as a key in a HashMap and also in a TreeMap simultaneously?

Answer: Yes, but you must implement both Comparable (or provide a Comparator) and correctly override hashCode() and equals() for consistent behavior.
6. Serialization and HashMaps
Q12: What happens if you serialize and deserialize a HashMap with custom objects as keys?
Answer: The Employee class must implement Serializable, and care must be taken that the hashCode() and equals() behavior remains consistent after deserialization.
7. Advanced Topics
Q13: Can a HashMap work correctly with a null key?

Answer: Yes, HashMap allows one null key. It always maps the null key to the first bucket.
Q14: How would you design a HashMap-like data structure where multiple keys can be treated as equal based on specific business logic?

Answer: Implement a custom Key class with a tailored hashCode() and equals() method. Alternatively, consider a MultiKeyMap from libraries like Apache Commons.
8. Coding Challenge
Q15: Write a program that counts the number of Employee objects in a List based on unique id.
Expected Answer: Use a HashMap<Employee, Integer> or a Set<Employee> to track unique employees based on the
overridden equals() and hashCode() methods.
import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    // Constructor
    public Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getters
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Override equals to compare based on id
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Employee employee = (Employee) obj;
        return id == employee.id;
    }

    // Override hashCode to generate hash based on id
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{id=" + id + ", name='" + name + "'}";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of employees
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
            new Employee(1, "Alice"),
            new Employee(2, "Bob"),
            new Employee(3, "Charlie"),
            new Employee(1, "Alice"), // Duplicate id
            new Employee(2, "Bob"),   // Duplicate id
            new Employee(4, "Diana")
        );

        // Use a HashSet to store unique employees by id
        Set<Employee> uniqueEmployees = new HashSet<>(employees);

        // Print the unique employees and their count
        System.out.println("Unique Employees: " + uniqueEmployees);
        System.out.println("Number of Unique Employees: " + uniqueEmployees.size());
    }
}
