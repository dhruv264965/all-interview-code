Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental concept in Spring Boot and other frameworks of the Spring ecosystem.
It is a design pattern that allows the developer to achieve loose coupling between components by injecting
dependencies into a class rather than creating them internally.
Inversion of Control (IoC): The control of creating and managing dependencies is transferred to the Spring IoC
container.
Loose Coupling: Classes are less dependent on each other because dependencies are managed externally.
Configurable Components: Dependencies can be injected dynamically, making it easier to configure and manage
components.
Constructor based DI->
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ServiceA {
    private final ServiceB serviceB;

    // Constructor-based injection
    @Autowired
    public ServiceA(ServiceB serviceB) {
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
    }

    public void execute() {
        serviceB.performTask();
    }
}

@Component
public class ServiceB {
    public void performTask() {
        System.out.println("Task executed by ServiceB.");
    }
}

setter based-
@Component
public class ServiceA {
    private ServiceB serviceB;

    @Autowired
    public void setServiceB(ServiceB serviceB) {
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        serviceB.performTask();
    }
}
field based-
@Component
public class ServiceA {
    @Autowired
    private ServiceB serviceB;

    public void doSomething() {
        serviceB.performTask();
    }
}
