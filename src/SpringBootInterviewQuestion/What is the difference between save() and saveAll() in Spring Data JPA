Both save() and saveAll() are methods provided by Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository to persist data in a
database, but they have key differences in how they handle transactions, performance, and usage.

1️⃣ save() – Saves a Single Entity
The save() method is used to persist or update a single entity in the database.

Method Signature

<S extends T> S save(S entity);
Saves a single entity (entity).

If the entity has an ID, it performs an update.

If the entity does not have an ID, it performs an insert.

Example Usage

Employee employee = new Employee(null, "John Doe", "john@example.com", "IT");
employeeRepository.save(employee);
Behavior
If employee.id is null → INSERT new record.

If employee.id is not null and exists → UPDATE existing record.

If employee.id is not null but doesn't exist → Throws EntityNotFoundException in some cases.

2️⃣ saveAll() – Saves Multiple Entities in Bulk
The saveAll() method is used to persist or update multiple entities in a single call.

Method Signature

<S extends T> List<S> saveAll(Iterable<S> entities);
Accepts a list of entities.

Performs batch processing, making it more efficient than multiple save() calls.

Still, inserts or updates entities based on their IDs.

Example Usage

List<Employee> employees = List.of(
    new Employee(null, "Alice", "alice@example.com", "HR"),
    new Employee(null, "Bob", "bob@example.com", "Finance")
);
employeeRepository.saveAll(employees);
3️⃣ Performance Differences
Feature	save() (Single Entity)	saveAll() (Multiple Entities)
Operation	Inserts/Updates 1 entity	Inserts/Updates multiple entities
Batch Processing	❌ No batch processing	✅ Uses batch processing (if enabled)
SQL Calls	Multiple calls for multiple entities	Fewer calls due to batching
Performance	Slower for large data sets	Faster for bulk operations
