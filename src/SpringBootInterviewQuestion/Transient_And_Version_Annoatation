@Version annotation is used to specify the version number for a specific entity. Version Number provided
using @Version annotation
is used to prevent concurrent modification to an entity. When an entity is being updated, the version number
is also incremented.
If another transaction tries to update the same entity with the older version number, an exception will be given.
The version number
helps to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions. @Version annotation is used for optimistic locking.
 Optimistic locking is
a concurrency control mechanism in which it ensures that concurrent transactions will not conflict with each
other. If there is a chance
of conflict during transactions the transaction having an older version number will be aborted
code- package com.example.java_test_application;

      // on the below line creating an entity
      // class for the class of Employee.
      @Entity
      public class Employee {
      // on the below line creating an employee id
      // generated value with the strategy for generation type.
      @Id
      @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
      private Long empId;
      private String employeeName;
      private String employeeQualification;

      // on the below line we are
      // using version annotation.
      @Version
      private int version;

      }
In the above example, we are considering an Employee entity with a version field annotated with @Version. The version field will be
used for optimistic locking. Whenever this entity field is being updated sequentially the value of the version is also checked to
ensure that it matches the current version in the database. If the version has changed, an exception will be thrown, indicating a
concurrent modification.

@Transient annotation in Hibernate is used to mark a property or field in an entity class as transient. This means that the field or
property marked as transient should be excluded when the data persists in the database. Wherever an entity is mapped to a database table,
 by default all the non-transient fields and properties are persisted. There are certain fields or properties in an entity that should
 be ignored during the data persistence process such as the data which is being calculated for displaying, temporary variables, and
 other data which is relevant only within the application logic but is not required in the database. By using the @Transient annotation
  to that field or a property Hibernate can exclude that field from the persistence process and the corresponding column will not be
  created in the database table.
  code-  // on the below line we are creating an entity for the
         // ProductInfo class.
         @Entity
         public class ProductInfo {
         	// on the below line we are creating a variable for
         	// product id.
         	@Id
         	@GeneratedValue
         	private Long productID;

         	// on the below line we are creating a string variable
         	// for product name
         	private String productName;

         	// on the below line creating a variable for product
         	// price.
         	private int productPrice;

         	// on the below line we are creating a variable for
         	// discounted price and marking it as transient to
         	// exclude it from data persistence in the database.
         	@Transient
         	private int discountPrice = productPrice * 5 / 100;
         }
In the above example, we are creating a Product Info entity class which has a field for productID, product name, product price a,d a
discounted price. We are marking the discounted price property as @Transient because we have to exclude the value of this variable from
 persisting in the database. We are calculating the value for a discounted price from the product price by using a specific
 multiplication factor. Marking it with @Transient annotation will exclude this variable from adding it to our database operations.

 @OrderBy annotation is used in Hibernate to specify the ordering of the elements in the collection valued property of an entity class.
  It is used to define the order of the elements which should be displayed. We can order the data within the entity using a specific
  parameter in ascending or descending order.
  code- // on the below line we are creating an entity for
        // department class.
        @Entity
        public class Department {
        	// on the below line we are creating a variable for
        	// department id.
        	@Id
        	@GeneratedValue
        	private Long departmentID;

        	// on the below line we are creating a string variable
        	// for department name.
        	private String departmentName;

        	// on the below line we are creating a variable for
        	// employees list and ordering it by employee name in
        	// ascending order.
        	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
        	@OrderBy("employeeName ASC")
        	private List<Employee> employees;
        }

        // on the below line we are creating an Employee class.
        @Entity
        public class Employee {
        	// on the below line we are creating an employee id
        	// variable.
        	@Id
        	@GeneratedValue
        	private Long empID;

        	// on the below line we are creating an employee name
        	// variable.
        	private String employeeName;

        	// on the below line we are creating a department
        	// variable and joining it with column using department
        	// id.
        	@ManyToOne
        	@JoinColumn(name = "departmentID")
        	private Department department;
        }
In the above example, the Department entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Employee entity. The @OrderBy annotation is applied
to the employee’s collection in the Department entity. It specifies that the associated Employee entities should be ordered by the
employee name field in ascending order. When the Department entity is being loaded from the Database, then the associated employee
entity will be called and ordered based on the employee names in ascending order. The @OrderBy annotation allows you to control the
order of elements in the collection-valued property which provides flexibility in how elements are retrieved and displayed in the
Spring application using Hibernate.
