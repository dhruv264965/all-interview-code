 @EnableAutoConfiguration->
1->It automatically configure the bean that are present in the classpath.
2->So what ever we added in pom.xml like spring-boot-starter-web  then DispatcherServlet,WebMvcConfigurer,
   Jackson for JSON,Embedded Tomcat or other web servers are requried so no need to configure these thing
   manually
3->Reduces boilerplate configuration — so you don’t have to manually define a lot of @Bean or
   XML configuration.


if we want to exclude some of the beans then we use
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = { DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class })

@SpringBootApplication-@ComponentScan
                       @EnableAutoConfiguration
                       @Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ComponentScan
1->Tells Spring where to find beans/components whenever it see @Component,@Service, @Repository,@Controller it
   help to discover the bean before manage by DI
2->It scan package and sub packages @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.service")
2->🔁 What Happens at Spring Startup?
   When a Spring application starts, it goes through several phases:

   A->Configuration Phase (Bean Discovery):
     Spring scans your code to find all classes annotated with:@Component,@Service, @Repository,@Controller
      This is where @ComponentScan comes in — it tells Spring which packages to scan.

  B-> Registration Phase (Bean Definition Creation):
    For each discovered class, Spring creates a "Bean Definition".
    This is just metadata — Spring hasn’t created actual objects yet, but it knows what needs to be created.

  C-> Instantiation Phase (DI Happens Here):
      Spring creates actual instances of the beans.
      Then, it injects dependencies (via @Autowired, constructors, etc.).
       This is Dependency Injection (DI).

3->Example to explain-
    @Component
    public class UserService {
        @Autowired
        private UserRepository userRepository;
    }
    @Repository
    public class UserRepository {
    }
  Step 1: @ComponentScan finds both UserService and UserRepository.
  Step 2: Spring registers them as beans.
  Step 3: Spring creates a UserRepository instance.
  Step 4: Spring creates a UserService instance and injects the UserRepository into it.
  If UserRepository was not discovered, UserService would fail during DI with a "No qualifying bean" error.
